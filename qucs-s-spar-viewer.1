.SH NAME
qucs-s-spar-viewer \- S-parameter data viewer with RF circuit synthesis tools
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B qucs-s-spar-viewer
[\fIOPTION\fR] ...
.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBqucs-s-spar-viewer\fR is an S-parameter data viewer with RF 
circuit design tools. It is part of the Qucs-S project.

The application supports visualization of S-parameter data from Touchstone 
files and Qucs datasets, offering multiple plot types including rectangular 
plots, Smith charts, and polar plots. It includes comprehensive synthesis 
tools for filter design, matching networks, power combiners, and attenuators.

.SH FEATURES

.SS Data Import
.TP
\fBTouchstone Files\fR
Read standard .snp files (S1P, S2P, S3P, etc.) supporting frequency sweeps 
in MA (Magnitude-Angle), RI (Real-Imaginary), and DB (dB-Angle) formats.
.TP
\fBQucs Datasets\fR
Import data from both Qucsator (S[i,j] matrix notation) and NGspice 
(ac.v(s_j_i) voltage source notation) formats.

.SS Visualization
.TP
\fBPlot Types\fR
Rectangular plots (Magnitude/Phase, Impedance, Stability, VSWR, Group Delay), 
Smith Charts (Z and Y chart options), and Polar plots.
.TP
\fBTrace Management\fR
Add, remove, and customize traces with adjustable color, width, and line style.
.TP
\fBMarkers\fR
Place frequency markers with automatic value readout for precise measurements.
.TP
\fBLimit Lines\fR
Define pass/fail criteria with frequency-dependent limits displayed as shaded 
regions on plots.

.SS Synthesis Tools
.TP
\fBFilter Design\fR
Canonical and Direct-Coupled LC filters, transmission line filters.
.TP
\fBMatching Networks\fR
L-section, stub-matching, and impedance transformers.
.TP
\fBPower Combiners\fR
Various topologies including Wilkinson, Bagley, Gysel, and Lim-Eom.
.TP
\fBAttenuators\fR
Pi, Tee, Bridged-Tee and tuned attenuators with power dissipation calculations.
.TP
\fBNetlist Scratchpad\fR
Text-based tool to simulate S-parameters of a netlist as you type.

All synthesis tools can export circuits to Qucs-S via clipboard for immediate 
schematic integration.

.SS Session Management
Save and load complete workspaces including all loaded datasets, plot 
configurations, trace properties, markers, limits, and notes. Session files 
use the .spar XML-based format.

.SH FILES
.TP
\fB*.snp\fR
Touchstone S-parameter data files (S1P, S2P, S3P, etc.)
.TP
\fB*.dat\fR
Qucs dataset files (Qucsator and NGspice formats)
.TP
\fB*.spar\fR
Session files storing complete application state
